# Workplace Monitoring

  We wish to design a software that helps us mark attendance of workers in a company. Firstly, we need a single picture of each employee with which our software will compare live images from a camera at the front gates. If a worker is spotted at the entrance, then the camera automatically detects them and checks if they have already been checked in that day. If not, the software will register the person along with the date and time of their arrival. In both cases, once it detects someone as an employee, the gate automatically opens for them to enter into the company campus. Otherwise, if the detected face is not employed there, an alert accompanied with a photo of the person is sent through the software to see if it might be an appointment or anything of the sort. After validation, the gate opens and the person can get in. 
    
 Secondly, the software is able to recognise a face with or without a medical mask so that if a person within working hours is detected not to be wearing one, they have to be expelled.
    
  Furthemore, our software detects number plates using OCR for two reasons. The first one is that it helps the company decide how to allocate transport allowances to their employees. The second is for security reasons in case of a break in or other unfortunate situations in which a company might require such identification.
    
 Lastly, if someone visits the buildings outside working hours, their face will be detected and sent out through the software which will in turn call the authorities unless the person is cleared to come inside. 

 There has evidently been countless usage of face recognition in the last decades. From governmental and military affairs, to phone security to even shopping with amazon's "Amazon Go". OCR has also grown massively as a computer vision solution for security but also hacking. However we have been seeing a lot of casual uses of OCR in the last decade for solver apps or even apple's IPhone making it now possible to copy text from a picture. On the other hand, mask detection has obviously only been popular in response to 2020's global pandemic as a means to enforce health restrictions. Ultimately, all three methods used here have been developed and perfected for the same reasons we are using them. All we are doing is putting all of them together in one software adjusted specifically for our case.
